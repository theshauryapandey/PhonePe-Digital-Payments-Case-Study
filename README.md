# 📊 PhonePe Digital Payments – Data Analysis & Visualization

This project explores how digital payments have evolved in India using transaction and demographic data from PhonePe. The goal was to analyze usage trends, user behavior, device patterns, and regional differences using real-world datasets across multiple years and states.

## 🧠 What I Did

I used Python, Excel, and visualization tools to:
- Analyze transaction volume and value across Indian states and districts
- Identify which devices people use the most on PhonePe
- Compare population density with app adoption
- Visualize trends over time (2018 to 2023)
- Build a clean, interactive dashboard
